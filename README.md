- 👋 Hi, I’m @Immaculated
- 👀 I'm interested in League of Legends
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python
- 💞️ I'm looking to learn C++ and collaborate on Yuzu - Nintendo Switch emulator
- 📫 I'm living in da house of cedar and pine
- 🐇 I suppose, that this readme file is boring. That's why I must add these mad rabbits in the grass right now 🌿🐇🌿🐇🌿🐇🌿
- 🌎 I'm currently inactive for long time. May be in a future I will start my developer's career
