- 👋 Hi, I’m @Immaculated
- 👀 I'm interested in League of Legends
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python
- 💞️ I'm looking to learn C++ and collaborate on Yuzu - Nintendo Switch emulator
- 📫 I'm living in da house of cedar and pine
- 🎤 I'm not only a developer, but also a versatile person: I make tracks in chopper fast flow hip-hop style, play ultimate frisbee, do kriya and raja yoga
- 💀 I've completed more projects than I have uploaded here, but I am too lazy to finish them, because I have stagnation without external stimulation
