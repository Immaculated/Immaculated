- 👋 Hi, I’m @Immaculated, so called in honor of Loc Sant's song.
- 👀 I'm interested in Wu Wei and searching extraterrestrial creatures.
- 💞️ Now I research Engagemant Optimized Matchmaking and Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in computer games and expose large gaming companies.
- 📫 I live in da house of cedar and pine in the Red Forest like in "12 Monkeys" series.
- 🐇 I suppose, this readme file is boring. That's why I must add these mad rabbits in the grass right now 🌿🐇🌿🐇🌿🐇🌿.
